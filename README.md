## Sections
Each section of the breviary will have a corresponding folder in this repository. Each will also have there own README to further explain the usage of that section. Each section is broken down into sub-sections Corresponding to the different offices, or in the case of a feast or vigil the name of the person or event celebrated. All of these can be further broken down into the season of the church year.

3.  The Proper of the Saints  (E Section)
4.  The Common of the Saints  (F,G,H & S Sections)\
