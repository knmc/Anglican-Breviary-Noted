# Anglican-Breviary-Noted
## Repository  of source files to create Gregorian Chants for the Divine Office

The Anglican Breviary like any other breviary is a complex work divied into many sections. This repository will use the same structure to capture the structure of the breviary.

## Structure

Each section of the breviary will have a corresponding folder in this repository. Each will also have there own README to further explain the usage of that section. Each section is broken down into sub-sections Corresponding to the different offices, or in the case of a feast or vigil the name of the person or event celebrated. All of these can be further broken down into the season of the church year.
